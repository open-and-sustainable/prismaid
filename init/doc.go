// Package init provides utilities for initializing and configuring the project through interactive
// terminal-based prompts. It includes features for collecting and validating user input to set up
// necessary configurations for the project.
//
// The package handles various types of user inputs including text entries, selections from predefined
// options, and confirmation prompts. It supports input validation with customizable rules to ensure
// configuration integrity.
//
// Typical usage involves calling the prompt functions in a sequence to gather all required
// configuration parameters, which are then saved to appropriate configuration files or environment
// variables. The package is designed to provide a user-friendly experience during project setup
// while ensuring all necessary configuration is completed correctly.
//
// This package is typically used during first-time setup or when reconfiguring the application,
// and works alongside other configuration management components in the project architecture.
