http://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2024.377,dimensions.dta,,Comparative life cycle assessment of on-site sanitation systems using lagoons or drying beds for fecal sludge treatment in low-income tropical countries,"Environmental challenges in low-income countries, such as Haiti, persist due to inadequate sanitation infrastructure. This study assesses the environmental impacts of nine on-site sanitation systems to identify those with the least environmental impacts and explore improvement options. Nine scenarios were developed, each representing different systems for managing 1 ton of fecal sludge over 1 year. The 'Impact World + ' and 'IPCC 2013 GWP 100a' methods evaluated impacts on ecosystems, human health, and climate change. Data sources included interviews, weighing records, and scientific publications. Results show that Scenario 8 (Flush Toilet - Evacuation - Planted Drying Beds) is most impactful on health (1.17 × 10-2 DALY), while Scenario 1 (Composting Toilet - Evacuation - Unplanted Drying Beds) is least impactful (1.77 × 10-3 DALY). For ecosystem impacts, Scenario 2 (Container-based Toilet - Evacuation - Planted Drying Beds) is most impactful (3.81 × 103 PDF·m2·year), while Scenario 6 (VIP latrine - Evacuation - Lagoons) is least impactful (3.52 × 103 PDF·m2·year). Key hotspots include toilet paper, wood shavings, GHG emissions, and water use. The study recommends an integrated approach combining environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) with life cycle cost assessment and social LCA for sustainable decision-making on sanitation systems in low-income countries.",Water Science & Technology,2024,"Jean-Baptiste, Davidson; Monette, Frédéric",en,[research_article empirical_study],[data sources impact assessment sustainability],[assessment of environmental impacts use of data for impact evaluation],0.65,0.75,[sample_study],map[empirical_study:0.95 research_article:0.95],research_article,[empirical_study],,,en,true,

To determine whether these expectations can be fulfilled or whether there are also negative consequences, social aspects should be assessed as early as the R&D phase. Potential social impacts can be assessed with the help of a social life cycle assessment (SLCA). A common problem in SLCA studies is the large number of social aspects. Thus, it is important to prioritize the most relevant aspects. Scholars agree that socioeconomic indicators should not be selected on a purely intuitive and common sense basis and that a standardized approach is missing. A three-step process has been developed to identify the most vulnerable and relevant social aspects. These three steps were implemented into a case study to empirically test the method. Short-rotation-coppice as an alternative form of agricultural dendromass production is one possibility to obtain wood resources for the processing of bio-based products. The use of agricultural land for dendromass production promises additional income for the region’s farmers and job opportunities for the local population. The extant literature shows that the most frequently addressed impacts are related to workers’ health and safety aspects. The outcome of this study aims to support future research by identifying an appropriate approach for the selection of indicators in SLCA. For studies with a similar focus, the proposed set of indicators can be used as a framework in itself or serve as a basis for the choice of relevant social indicators.",BioEnergy Research,2021,"Fürtner, Daniela; Ranacher, Lea; Perdomo Echenique, E.

Our ELCA results indicate that fodder co-production offers an advantage in the following categories: climate change (biogenic land use and land use change total), ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, ionizing radiation, photochemical ozone creation, and land use. By contrast, the AF + energy system yields lower impacts in the other 11 out of 19 Environmental Footprint impact categories. Only AF + fodder offers greenhouse gas reduction compared to petroleum diesel (-25%). Our SLCA results indicate that AF + fodder yields lower impacts in the following categories: fair salaries, forced labor, gender wage gap, health expenditure, unemployment, and violation of employment laws and regulations. AF + energy performs favorably in the other three out of nine social indicators. We conclude that the choice of co-products has a strong influence on the sustainability of algal fuel production. Despite this, none of the compared systems are found to yield a consistent advantage in the environmental or social dimension. It is, therefore, not possible to recommend a co-production strategy without weighing environmental and social issues.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2021,"Portner, Benjamin W.; Valente, Antonio; Guenther, Sandy",en,[research_article empirical_study],[social life cycle assessment (SLCA) social indicators life cycle assessment social impacts],[social impact assessment comparative S-LCA social indicators in LCA],0.75,0.85,[sample_study],map[empirical_study:0.95 research_article:0.95],research_article,[empirical_study],,,en,true,
https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1118092727,dimensions.dta,,Environmental and social life cycle assessment of urban water systems: The case of Mexico City,"Mexico City and its metropolitan area have suffered problems of sustainability in the water system. The main goals of this study were to assess the environmental and social impacts of the water system in Mexico City using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), identify the significant impacts and their sources, and provide a new perspective for a sustainable water system in the city. The entire water system was considered, including the following stages: water abstraction and treatment, transport, distribution, use, sewage collection and wastewater treatment. Social Life Cycle Assessment was performed considering the UNEP/SETAC Guidelines for the Social-LCA of products and the water system workers. We used five subcategories (working hours, fair wage, health and safety conditions, social security and professional development) and 30 indicators of labor conditions. The results of LCA show that the processes of abstraction, water treatment, transport and distribution combined to produce between 83.9 and 89.6% of the impacts in four of six categories. However, the transportation stage generates the highest environmental impacts due to energy consumption. The wastewater treatment stage avoids environmental impacts in freshwater eutrophication (-69.9%) and non-carcinogenic effects (-86.2%) due to Atotonilco, the new centralized WWTP. The social life cycle assessment results indicated that the transport stage had the best social performance score, with a value of 0.3 on a scale of zero to one. The total system exhibited regular performance in health and safety conditions, with a value of 0.6 in this category. Moving toward a sustainable water system in Mexico City requires analyze future scenarios on the decentralization of potable water services and the implementation of renewable energy technologies in water abstraction and transport to reduce electrical energy consumption and mitigate global warming impacts. Regarding the social dimension, the water system requires stricter policies to monitor the health and safety conditions of workers according to the definition of decent work toward recent sustainable development goals. This study allowed us to identify the stages with high and low environmental impacts with LCA and, with S-LCA, the best and worst social performance in working conditions. The next step is to complete a sustainability assessment that includes the economic dimension, develop a framework to integrate the three dimensions and propose scenarios to improve environmental and social performance.",The Science of The Total Environment,2019,"García-Sánchez, Maribel; Güereca, Leonor Patricia",en,[research_article empirical_study sample_study],[social life cycle assessment S-LCA social indicators social impacts UNEP/SETAC Guidelines],[social impacts assessment application of S-LCA to water systems use of social indicators in LCA assessment of social conditions in infrastructure systems],0.78,0.85,[sample_study],map[empirical_study:0.95 research_article:0.95 sample_study:0.9],research_article,[empirical_study],,,en,true,

The objective of this article is to consider the available options to quantify corruption in preventative cost-based S-LCA, and to make a first proposal for quantification.MethodsLiterature was investigated on potential S-LCA assessment methods of corruption. To date, such literature is hardly available, so more generally, S-LCA methods were assessed on described concepts and ideas, and assessed on five criteria. Following this, using the obtained conclusions and ideas, a proposal for the quantification of corruption for the preventative cost-based Oiconomy system was developed, following the five-step Oiconomy method (Croes and Vermeulen in J Clean Prod 102:178–187, 2015).Results and discussionBased on some examples, Dreyer et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess 15(3):247–259, 2010) argue that various social aspects, including corruption, are better assessed by companies’ preventative efforts than by their impact. Therefore, modifying a method developed by Dreyer et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess 15(3):247–259, 2010), an indicator is proposed provided by the product of the marginal preventative costs and the quality of a companies’ preventative governance. For the aspect of corruption, the internationally accepted target is “zero tolerance.” Literature shows that the ultimate business choice under pressure of corruption is “not doing the business.” Because profitability is the main driver for companies, refraining from the business is proposed as the marginal preventative measure, and the related profit as the maximum quantitative indicator for S-LCA. For the risk factor, a technique is proposed based on scoring a company’s governance quality by checking the four Plan-Do-Check-Act effort classes of common risk-based certification standards’ criteria.ConclusionsOur assessment shows a definite need for the inclusion of the aspect of corruption in S-LCA, but no options for a reasonably certain assessment are available for the aspect of corruption in impact-based S-LCA, also suitable for the preventative cost-based Oiconomy system. However, based on literature-derived ideas and principles, for the Oiconomy system, we could propose both a performance reference point and marginal preventative costs as a quantitative measure for corruption. The proposed measure is not paying the bribe, but the proposed indicator is a governance quality-dependent fraction of the consequentially lost profit margin. Consequences, limitations and possible objections to our proposed methods are discussed.",The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,2018,"Croes, Pim R.; Vermeulen, Walter J.

https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105341555,dimensions.dta,,The energy-mineral-society nexus – A social LCA model,"Renewable energy technologies such as direct-drive wind turbines based on permanent magnets need non-renewable resources such as rare earth minerals. The analysis of this nexus requires a better understanding of the complex interactions not only between these two sectors, but also between the natural environment and human society, characterized as the energy-mineral-society nexus (EMS nexus). The EMS nexus is analysed using an extended social life cycle assessment (sLCA) model and scenario approach. For this new social LCA the Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) is used to analyse rare earth production in Australia, Malaysia (Mount Weld process), USA (Mountain Pass process II), and China (Bayan Obo process). On the basis of the Social Hotspots Database (SHDB), the sLCA model allows to determine the social footprint of the production of rare earth elements based permanent magnets for 2012. Furthermore the social LCA model approach also enables a new interpretation of the societal life cycle costing (sLCC). The social risks are monetized for the three rare earth production chains. By integrating the Human Development Index (HDI), the new approach allows a novel scenario estimation of the social footprint and the social risk intensity for the three rare earth production sites. In addition to the scientific contribution, the results provide a central input for the public discussion about corporate social compliance, according to which companies try to improve the social standards along their global value chains in line with the social accountability 8000 (SA8000) standard.",Applied Energy,2018,"Schlör, H.; Venghaus, S.; Zapp, P.; Marx, J.; Schreiber, A.; Hake, J.-Fr.",en,[research_article empirical_study],[social life cycle assessment (sLCA) Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) social footprint scenario approach],"[definitions and methodological approaches to S-LCA case studies presenting original S-LCA assessments application of S-LCA to specific products, industries, or supply chains]",0.78,0.85,[sample_study],map[empirical_study:0.9 research_article:0.95],research_article,[empirical_study],,,en,true,
https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101836254,dimensions.dta,,Integrated life cycle sustainability assessment using fuzzy inference: A novel FELICITA model,"This paper presents a new FELICITA (Fuzzy Evaluation for Life Cycle Integrated Sustainability Assessment) model which integrates life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC) and social LCA (SLCA) into a fuzzy inference framework. The input data for the model are sustainability indicators estimated through LCA, LCC and SLCA. These are first normalised, then fuzzified, processed using the Mamdani fuzzy inference system and finally defuzzified using the centre-of-area method. This results in three composite indicators, one each for LCA, LCC and SLCA, providing crisp numerical values. This process is then repeated, using the composite indicators as the inputs to obtain an overall life cycle sustainability indicator for each alternative being considered in the decision-making process. These results are used to rank alternatives of interest and identify the most sustainable option(s). The application of the model is illustrated by a case study considering different electricity technologies. FELICITA is particularly useful in helping deal with imprecise (fuzzy) information often encountered in sustainability assessments and it can be used as a practical tool for decision making and policy development related to sustainable development.",Sustainable Production and Consumption,2018,"Kouloumpis, Victor; Azapagic, Adisa",en,[research_article methods_paper],[social LCA (SLCA) sustainability indicators life cycle assessment fuzzy evaluation decision-making],[integration of social indicators with environmental or economic LCA methodological approaches to S-LCA application of S-LCA in sustainability assessment],0.75,0.85,[sample_study],map[methods_paper:0.85 research_article:0.95],research_article,[methods_paper],,,en,true,

In this paper, a search for all peer-reviewed publications on applied Social LCA, which have appeared in scientific journals, between O’Brien et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess 1(4):231–237, 1996) and the latest one at the time of writing (April 2018), was carried out, using Scopus as the repository and using ‘S-LCA’ or ‘SLCA’ or ‘Social LCA’ or ‘social life cycle assessment’ as search phrases in title, abstract and keywords of publications, separately. Overall, 213 publications were unearthed, and the trend shows that there has been a near-exponential increase over time. A little over 55% of these publications—121 to be precise—were applications of S-LCA—often in combination with environmental LCA and life cycle costing analysis, in an LCSA. This paper discusses the contributions of a selected subset of these 121 publications to the body of S-LCA knowledge, with the focus being restricted to applications in developing and transition economies of the world, on the premise that there is a more urgent need to understand social aspects of production and manufacturing in these parts of the world. A SWOT analysis of S-LCA has been carried out towards the end. There is a consensus among many researchers that while LCC and E-LCA have matured a lot over time, S-LCA, the newest of the trio, is evolving slowly to become a harmonised tool which can serve as an effective complement to the aforesaid two, in LCSAs of products and processes in industry.Graphical abstract",Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,2018,"Venkatesh, G.",en,[research_article empirical_study],[S-LCA social life cycle assessment applications of S-LCA],[applications of S-LCA trend analysis of S-LCA publications social LCA in sustainability assessment],0.78,0.85,[sample_study],map[empirical_study:0.9 research_article:0.95],research_article,[empirical_study],,,en,true,
