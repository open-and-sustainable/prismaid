### Screening Tool Configuration Template
### This template provides all available options for manuscript screening

### The [project] section contains basic information and paths
[project]
name = "Manuscript Screening Example"           # Project title
author = "John Doe"                            # Project author
version = "1.0"                                # Configuration version
input_file = "/path/to/manuscripts.csv"        # Input CSV or TXT file with manuscript data
output_file = "/path/to/screening_results"     # Output file path (without extension)
text_column = "abstract"                       # Column name containing text or path to text files
identifier_column = "doi"                      # Column name for unique identifiers (optional, auto-generated if empty)
output_format = "csv"                          # Output format: "csv" or "json"
log_level = "medium"                          # Log level: "low", "medium", or "high"

### The [filters] section configures which screening filters to apply
[filters]

### Deduplication filter - identifies duplicate manuscripts
[filters.deduplication]
enabled = false
use_ai = false                              # Use AI model for similarity detection
compare_fields = ["title", "abstract"]     # Fields to compare for duplication

### Language detection filter - screens by language
[filters.language]
enabled = true                                 # Enable language filter
accepted_languages = ["en", "es", "fr"]       # ISO language codes to accept
use_ai = false                                # Use AI for detection (requires LLM config)

### Article type classification filter
### Note: Articles can have multiple overlapping types (e.g., a paper can be both "research_article" AND "empirical_study" AND "sample_study")
[filters.article_type]
enabled = true                                 # Enable article type filter
use_ai = false                                 # Use AI for classification (requires LLM config)

# Traditional publication type exclusions
exclude_reviews = true                        # Exclude all review types (review, systematic_review, meta_analysis)
exclude_editorials = true                     # Exclude editorials
exclude_letters = true                        # Exclude letters to editor
exclude_case_reports = false                  # Exclude case reports
exclude_commentary = false                    # Exclude commentary articles
exclude_perspectives = false                  # Exclude perspective articles

# Methodological type exclusions (can overlap with publication types)
exclude_theoretical = false                   # Exclude theoretical/conceptual papers
exclude_empirical = false                     # Exclude empirical studies with data
exclude_methods = false                       # Exclude methods/methodology papers

# Study scope exclusions (applies to empirical studies)
exclude_single_case = false                   # Exclude single case studies (n=1, individual cases)
exclude_sample = false                        # Exclude sample studies (cohorts, cross-sectional, multiple subjects)

include_types = []                            # If specified, ONLY include these types
                                             # Available types: "research_article", "review", "systematic_review",
                                             # "meta_analysis", "editorial", "letter", "case_report", "commentary",
                                             # "perspective", "empirical_study", "theoretical_paper", "methods_paper",
                                             # "single_case_study", "sample_study"

### Topic relevance filter - screens manuscripts based on topic relevance
[filters.topic_relevance]
enabled = false                               # Enable topic relevance filter
use_ai = false                                # Use AI for relevance scoring (requires LLM config)
topics = []                                   # List of topic descriptions to match against
                                             # Example: ["machine learning in healthcare",
                                             #           "artificial intelligence applications in medical diagnosis",
                                             #           "deep learning for clinical decision support"]
min_score = 0.5                              # Minimum relevance score (0.0-1.0) to include manuscript

# Weights for different scoring components (should sum to a positive value)
[filters.topic_relevance.score_weights]
keyword_match = 0.4                          # Weight for direct keyword matches
concept_match = 0.4                          # Weight for conceptual/phrase matches
field_relevance = 0.2                        # Weight for journal/field relevance

### LLM configuration for AI-assisted screening (optional)
### Multiple LLMs can be configured for ensemble processing
### First LLM configuration
[[filters.llm]]
provider = "OpenAI"                           # Provider: "OpenAI", "GoogleAI", "Cohere", "Anthropic", "DeepSeek", or "Perplexity"
api_key = ""                                  # API key (uses environment variable if empty)
model = "gpt-4o-mini"                         # Model name (provider-specific)
temperature = 0.01                            # Temperature (0-1 for most providers, 0-2 for GoogleAI)
tpm_limit = 0                                 # Tokens per minute limit (0 = unlimited)
rpm_limit = 0                                 # Requests per minute limit (0 = unlimited)

### Additional LLM configurations (optional)
# [[filters.llm]]
# provider = "GoogleAI"
# api_key = ""
# model = "gemini-1.5-flash"
# temperature = 0.01
# tpm_limit = 0
# rpm_limit = 0

### Example configurations for different scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Simple deduplication only
# [project]
# name = "Deduplication Only"
# input_file = "manuscripts.csv"
# output_file = "deduplicated"
# text_column = "content"
# identifier_column = "id"
# output_format = "csv"
# log_level = "low"
#
# [filters]
# [filters.deduplication]
# enabled = true
# method = "exact"
# compare_fields = ["title", "doi"]
#
# [filters.language]
# enabled = false
#
# [filters.article_type]
# enabled = false

### Scenario 2: Language filtering for English-only manuscripts
# [project]
# name = "English Only Filter"
# input_file = "manuscripts.csv"
# output_file = "english_only"
# text_column = "abstract"
# identifier_column = "pmid"
# output_format = "json"
# log_level = "medium"
#
# [filters]
# [filters.deduplication]
# enabled = false
#
# [filters.language]
# enabled = true
# accepted_languages = ["en"]
# use_ai = false
#
# [filters.article_type]
# enabled = false

### Scenario 3: Exclude reviews and editorials, keep only research articles
# [project]
# name = "Research Articles Only"
# input_file = "all_papers.csv"
# output_file = "research_only"
# text_column = "full_text_path"  # Can be a path to text files
# identifier_column = "paper_id"
# output_format = "csv"
# log_level = "high"
#
# [filters]
# [filters.deduplication]
# enabled = true
# method = "fuzzy"
# threshold = 0.9
# compare_fields = ["title", "abstract"]
#
# [filters.language]
# enabled = true
# accepted_languages = ["en"]
# use_ai = false
#
# [filters.article_type]
# enabled = true
# use_ai = false
# exclude_reviews = true           # Excludes review, systematic_review, meta_analysis
# exclude_editorials = true
# exclude_letters = true
# exclude_case_reports = true
# exclude_commentary = true
# exclude_perspectives = false
# exclude_theoretical = true       # Focus on empirical work
# exclude_single_case = true       # Exclude single cases (n=1)
# include_types = ["empirical_study", "sample_study"]  # Only include papers that are BOTH empirical AND multi-subject

### Scenario 4: Topic-based filtering for specific research area
# [project]
# name = "AI in Healthcare Papers"
# input_file = "manuscripts.csv"
# output_file = "ai_healthcare_papers"
# text_column = "abstract"
# identifier_column = "doi"
# output_format = "json"
# log_level = "medium"
#
# [filters]
# [filters.deduplication]
# enabled = false
#
# [filters.language]
# enabled = true
# accepted_languages = ["en"]
# use_ai = false
#
# [filters.article_type]
# enabled = false
#
# [filters.topic_relevance]
# enabled = true
# use_ai = false
# topics = [
#     "artificial intelligence in healthcare and medicine",
#     "machine learning for medical diagnosis and treatment",
#     "deep learning applications in clinical settings",
#     "AI-powered medical imaging and radiology",
#     "predictive analytics for patient outcomes",
#     "natural language processing for electronic health records"
# ]
# min_score = 0.6     # Require 60% relevance score
# [filters.topic_relevance.score_weights]
# keyword_match = 0.4
# concept_match = 0.4
# field_relevance = 0.2

### Notes:
# 1. The input file should have column headers in the first row
# 2. The text_column can contain either:
#    - Actual text content (abstracts, full text)
#    - Paths to text files that will be read
# 3. If identifier_column is not specified or doesn't exist, auto-generated IDs will be used
# 4. The output file will include all original columns plus new tag columns
# 5. Excluded manuscripts will have "include" = false and an "exclusion_reason"
# 6. When using AI features, ensure API keys are configured
# 7. Filters are applied in order: deduplication -> language -> article_type -> topic_relevance
# 8. Article types are not mutually exclusive - a paper can be classified as multiple types
#    For example: a paper can be "research_article" + "empirical_study" + "sample_study"
# 9. Exclusion criteria check ALL assigned types (e.g., if a paper is both "review" and "systematic_review",
#    it will be excluded if exclude_reviews=true)
# 10. Topic relevance scoring assigns a score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on how well the manuscript matches the specified topics
# 11. Topic descriptions should be detailed phrases rather than simple keywords for better matching
